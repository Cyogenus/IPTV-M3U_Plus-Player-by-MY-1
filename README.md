Xtream & m3u_plus IPTV Player by My-1
This project is a feature-rich IPTV player built using Python and PyQt5, designed to work with both M3U_plus playlists and Xtream Codes API. The player allows users to easily manage and play IPTV channels, movies, and series directly from their playlists.

Features
M3U_plus Playlist Support:
Load and Play Channels: Supports loading M3U_plus playlists containing live TV channels, movies, and series.
Categorized Playlist: Channels are organized into tabs (Live TV, Movies, and Series) for easy navigation.
Playlist Navigation: Efficient 'Go Back' functionality to navigate between categories and sub-categories.
External Player Support: Channels can be played using an external VLC player.
Xtream Codes API Support:
Xtream API Login: Log in using your Xtream Codes API credentials (URL, Username, and Password).
Dynamic Playlist Loading: Fetches live TV, movie, and series categories upon login and dynamically loads channels or episodes when categories are selected.
Series Navigation: Allows navigation through series categories and streams specific episodes from the Xtream API.
Playlist Tabs: Like the M3U player, Xtream API playlists are displayed in Live TV, Movies, and Series tabs.
Error Handling: Graceful error handling for failed playlist loading or invalid stream URLs.
Best Player for Streaming: VLC
For the best experience, it is recommended to use VLC media player to play channels and streams. VLC is a robust, open-source media player that supports various streaming formats and ensures smooth playback for IPTV content.
